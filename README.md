 Interface of the vending machine includes buttons for 3 chocolate types and 3 LEDs with a Pressure sensor.
 The required coins must be placed on the pressure sensor and then the chocolate button pressed. The chocloate is dispensed via stepper motor if sufficient pressure is found on the sensor. If the chocolate is not available then the corresponding LED glows.
